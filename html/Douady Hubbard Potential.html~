<h1>Douady-Hubbard Potential</h1>
The 
<a href="http://linas.org/art-gallery/escape/escape.html">generalization of the integer iteration count</a>
gives us a handy tool for computing other quantities, including Douady-Hubbard rays.
<br><br><br>
This is because the renormalized count can be used to provide a simple
expression for the Douady-Hubbard potential.  
<br><br><br>


We give the the expression,
and then prove that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_theory">the potential</a> is indeed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_function">harmonic</a>, immediately below.
<p>
The iterated quadratic is
</p><p>
z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>+c
</p>

<br><br><br>

<p>
<strong>The renormalized iteration count</strong> m is
</p><p>
m(R) = n+1 - log(log |z<sub>n</sub>|) / log 2
</p><p>
where we have picked an escape radius R, and defined n to be the
smallest n such that R &lt; |z<sub>n</sub>| .  Then, as shown on the 
<a href="http://linas.org/art-gallery/escape/escape.html">Escape Page</a>, m(R) is 
'almost' independent of R and n, in the sense that m approaches a 
well-defined limit as R-&gt;oo, and, in fact, converges very rapidly.
It is also 'almost' continuous and smooth, in the sense that 
there are only a measure-zero of discontinuities for finite R, and that 
all discontinuities are bounded, and get vanishingly small in the limit 
of R-&gt;oo.  That is, in the limit, m becomes continuous and
smooth, and, as a practical, computational matter, is plenty smooth
enough for small R (100 to 10000).  Below, when we write m, we sometimes
mean the limit m(R-&gt;oo) and sometimes m(R) for finite R, and most
of the statements apply to either.
</p><p>
<strong>The Douady-Hubbard potential</strong> f is just
</p><p>
f = e<sup>-m log2</sup> = 2<sup>-m</sup>
</p>




<p>
Let us now show that f is harmonic, both in the limit R-&gt;oo and
for finite R, and that it has the right asymptotic behavior.
The limitations of html make this presentation hard.  Please bear with
us as we define some basic notation.
</p>
<br><br><br>

<p>
Lets define D as <strong>the derivative with respect to c</strong> 
where c is a complex variable c=x+iy in the usual fashion:
</p>

<p>
D = d/dc = (d/dx - id/dy)/2
</p><p>
and <u>D</u> as <strong>complex conjugate of D</strong>
</p>


<p>
<u>D</u> = d/d<u>c</u> = (d/dx + id/dy)/2
</p><p>
where we use an underline because 'overline', the usual way of showing this, is not available in html.  
<br><br><br>


<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator">The harmonic or Laplacian operator </a></strong> is then just  
</p><p>
 4 D<u>D</u> = d<sup>2</sup>/dx<sup>2</sup> + d<sup>2</sup>/dy<sup>2</sup>
</p><p>
<br><br><br>


Lets review some trivial factoids to make sure we're on the same
page. Since z<sub>n</sub>(c,<u>c</u>) = z<sub>n</sub>(c) is not a 
function of <u>c</u>, we have <u>D</u>z = D<u>z</u> = 0 .  The modulus 
is just |z| = sqrt(z<u>z</u>), and the derivative of the modulus is 
D|z| =  <u>z</u> Dz / (2|z|) . 
<br><br><br>

We can now combine these to compute <strong>the Laplacian of the the renormalized iteration count</strong>:
</p><p>
4 D<u>D</u> m = Dz<sub>n</sub> <u>Dz</u><sub>n</sub> / 
                (log 2 |z<sub>n</sub>|<sup>2</sup> log<sup>2</sup> |z<sub>n</sub>|)
</p><p>
Note that this depends implicitly on the escape radius R, since by definition,
R &lt; |z<sub>n</sub>|.  Thus, it would seem that the harmonic can be made 
arbitrarily small, provided the numerator was bounded.  Unfortunately, it 
is not; not only is it unbounded, but it diverges 'worse than
exponentially' as one approaches the boundary of the M-set.
</p>

<br><br><br>


<p>
<strong>The Laplacian of the potential</strong> is
</p><p>
4 D<u>D</u> f = 4f (log<sup>2</sup>2 Dm <u>D</u>m - log2 D<u>D</u>m)
</p><p>
But
</p><p>
Dm = D|z<sub>n</sub>| / (log2 |z<sub>n</sub>| log |z<sub>n</sub>|) 
</p><p>
Substituting from the above, we can easily see 
</p><p>
D<u>D</u> f = 0
</p><p>
both for finite R and R-&gt;oo.  For finite R, f has 'small'
discontinuities, which vanish in the limit;  thus the harmonic is
non-zero on the discontinuities, but these vanish in the limit, and 
f is harmonic everywhere outside the M-set.  
To complete this analysis of this
function, we check the asymptotic behavior.  
For finite R, we can write f(R) = 2<sup>-(n+1)</sup> log |z<sub>n</sub>| .
Thus, for c approaching the boundary of the M-set, n gets infinitely large,
whereas |z<sub>n</sub>| &lt; R<sup>2</sup>
and so f=0 on the boundary.
At the other end, for large c, we can approximate 
z<sub>n+1</sub> ~z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> for any n, and so 
</p><p>
m ~ 2 - log(log |c|) / log 2
</p><p>
and
</p><p>
f ~ log |c| / 4 
</p><p>
for large c.
</p>


<br><br><br>

<p>
Now that we have f, we should play a few games.  
We could draw a picture of f, but that in fact is 'boring'. f gets exponentially flat as it approaches the boundary of 
the M-set, and thus, it looks like a very blurry low-res picture of the M-set.  Boring.
</p>

<br><br><br>



<p>
<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient">The gradient</a> of potential</strong> is more interesting. 

<p>
G(f) = 2Df = f <u>z</u><sub>n</sub> Dz<sub>n</sub> / 
       |z<sub>n</sub>|<sup>2</sup> log |z<sub>n</sub>|
</p>

The gradient always points 'uphill'.
</p>

<br><br>



<p>
The picture below shows <strong>the modulus of the gradient</strong>.  


Of course, it resembles a coronal discharge.  If one were to cut out 
a metal plate in the shape of an M-set, apply a high voltage to it,
it is exactly this that you would see, because it is the areas of high
electric field (gradient) where the coronal ionization will occur.
Maybe make a chic lightning rod for the barn.

The next picture encodes <strong>the angle of the landing rays on the M-set</strong>.

It is nothing more than the phase = angle of the gradient. The color coding is such that black=0, blue=small angle, green=pi,
red=2pi.  In other words, green points west, and red/black points east, just as it was in the Soviet era.

This last image shows some <strong>landing rays</strong>.

A 'landing ray' is just the integral flow along the gradient lines of
the potential; i.e. the path a rock rolling down the hill to the M-set
would take.  We've picked 31 evenly-spaced angles at infinity; the red
lines indicate the flow along these paths.  The color gradations help 
show the behavior of some neighboring rays: i.e. the blue rays are
nearby neighbors of the red rays. The spreading as they 'land' on the 
M-set just helps show that rays become radically divergent.  The
Mandelbrot interior is an artifact of the algorithm, and are not a part
of the Douady-Hubbard isomorphism.
